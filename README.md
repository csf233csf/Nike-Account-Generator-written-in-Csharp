# Nike-Account-Generator-written-in-Csharp

Bug: 
1. User-Agent from BOGUS sometimes is unusable causing the form of the website to change. Put in your own User-Agent to be sure.

Things to add:
1. SMSCODE API support
2. Rewrite the loop to have better error-handle
3. Proxy Support

1/14
In order to collect useragent that's usable, now after an account is generated, it writes a file that contains all the usable useragent.
Improved sleeping time.
