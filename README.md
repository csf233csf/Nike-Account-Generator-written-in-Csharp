# Nike-Account-Generator-written-in-Csharp

Bug: 
1. User-Agent from BOGUS sometimes is unusable causing the form of the website to change. Put in your own User-Agent to be sure.

Things to add:
1. SMSCODE API support
2. Rewrite the loop to have better error-handle
3. Proxy Support

# Update: 
This is very basic selenium usage with no resquest involved.
The key to make this kind of bot work is to have a good User-Agent base that can "pass" nike's antibot detection. (Also a randomized delay between each action to make the process as humanized as possible.)
This project is for academic and learning purposes. You can refer this project to find the Xpath/elements of nike's web source but don't take it seriously and don't try to make a profit from it since I didn't implement proxy support and SMS api.
